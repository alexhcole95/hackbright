## Exercise: GameShell
Play an interactive game in the shell to practice navigating the filesystem and manipulating files with the command line.

### Getting Started
Run the command for your filesystem (below) to install the dependencies for the game:

    brew install nano pstree tree man-db wget

[Click here to download the game script](https://fellowship.hackbrightacademy.com/materials/shiptm1-devops/_downloads/57324269ba2b1211dd8aa45f5489c35d/devops-gameshell-1.zip). Unzip the file and note the location of **gameshell/gameshell.sh**. You’ll need to execute this file as a shell script in your terminal. In the terminal, navigate to the location of **gameshell.sh** and run the following command to start the game:

    ./gameshell.sh

**permission denied error**
If you can’t execute **gameshell.sh** due to a `permission denied` error, run the command below to make the file executable before trying again:

    sudo chmod +x gameshell.sh
