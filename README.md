## DevOps Mini-Bootcamp: Program Syllabus

A five week mini-bootcamp for DevOps and DataOps.

    Duration: 5 weeks  
    Days:     Monday–Friday  
    Time:     9:00 AM to 5:00 PM  

### Program Description

This program is a five week “mini-bootcamp” for building devops and production engineering skills. Specifically, we’ll be completing a series of projects that will give you the practical knowledge toward writing scripts with Python and Bash as well as common deployment and infrastructure orchestration techniques. Along the way, we’ll read explanations of concepts and underlying technologies involved in each project. We’ll also have opportunities to meet several times a week, as a class, to ask questions about what we’re learning, do deep-dives into specific topics, and discuss our work. Finally, you’ll culminate all the skills you’ve learned into a personal capstone project.

Topics we’ll cover in the program include: Unix, shell scripting, Python scripting, file i/o, parsing plaintext data formats, system design concepts.


### Prerequisites

The coursework assumes proficiency in a modern programming language. You don’t need to have any Python or Bash experience.


### Objectives and Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this program, you’ll be able to build and deploy an HTTP endpoint. Specific learning objectives are:

- Write and document Python programs that perform specific tasks.
- Use the Unix shell to navigate the filesystem, manipulate files, output diagnostics, and run programs.
- Learn how web-based, distributed systems work and intercommunicate.


### Required Materials
To attend and participate in class, you’ll need a computer and a stable Internet connection. You’ll also need the following supplemental technologies.

#### Zoom

We use Zoom to meet as a class. You’ll need to download and install the Zoom desktop client on your computer. Instructions on how to install the desktop client are linked in the resources below.

#### Discord

Discord is our hub for class announcements, discussion, and collaboration. It has instant messaging, voice chat, and screen share capabilities. It’s a place for you to collaborate and share knowledge with your cohortmates as well as receive support group and one-on-one support from staff.

You’ll need to download and install the Discord desktop application on your computer. We also recommend installing the Discord mobile app on your phone.


### Course Format

This is a remote, distance learning bootcamp. You’re expected to be in class every weekday between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM Central Time. Additional components of the course format are described below.

#### Daily Stand Up

Every morning, you’ll join a Zoom call with staff and cohortmates for a daily stand up. Staff will kick off the meeting with announcements and reminders. Then, you and your cohortmates will each take turns to share:

- An update on the work you’ve completed so far
- What you’re stuck on and need help with
- What you plan to work on that day

#### Supported Independent Learning Time

The rest of the day is yours to work on the course material. You’re expected to be online and easily reachable by Discord chat and voice call. Pay attention to the announcements channel as staff may hold office hours or other events, like lectures and discussions, during this time.

During afternoons, you’ll also have access to receiving academic support from a subject matter expert (SME). You can request one-on-one help with a specific topic or problem using a dedicated channel on Discord.
