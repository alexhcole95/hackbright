## Exercise: GitHub Basics
This exercise will simulate a typical workflow for a GitHub project. You’ll create and merge a pull request, review another developer’s pull request, and resolve merge conflicts.


### Intro to GitHub
Start using repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests through a simulated GitHub experienced powered by GitHub Actions.

#### Setup
[Click here to get started.](https://github.com/SEIBootcamps/introduction-to-github/generate) Clicking on the link will generate a new repository based on a template repository where GitHub Actions have been configured and set up to trigger at various points in the exercise. In the window that appears, follow the prompts to create a new repository. Then, wait 20 seconds for content to populate and refresh the page. Follow the instructions in your new repository’s README file when it appears.


### Communicate using Markdown
This will walk you through creating and using headings more effectively, organizing thoughts in bulleted lists, and showing how much work you’ve completed with checklists. You can even use Markdown to add some depth to your work with the help of emoji, images, and links.

#### Setup

[Click here to get started](https://github.com/SEIBootcamps/communicate-using-markdown/generate). This will generate a new repository based on a template just like before. Follow the instructions in your new repository’s README file when it appears.


### Review Pull Requests
All great projects start with collaboration. Pull requests are the foundation of teamwork on GitHub — and pull request reviews give you the ability to work together and discuss changes specific to a pull request by commenting, requesting changes, or approving.

#### Setup

### Resolve Merge Conflicts
Merge conflicts happen when two people make changes to the same file on GitHub — a common occurrence when you’re working with others. While resolving differences might involve some discussion, merge conflicts don’t have to be scary. This guides you through the steps to finding the best merge conflict solution, so your team can keep building.
