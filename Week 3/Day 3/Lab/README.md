## Exercise: Releases and GitHub Actions
Learn how to create a release based workflow on GitHub, set up continuous integration using GitHub Actions, and how to navigate a repository to find important information.


### Release Based Workflow
Create a release based workflow built on the foundations of the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). When your team uses a release-based workflow, GitHub makes it easy to collaborate with deployable iterations of your project that you can package and make available for a wider audience to download and use. In this lab, you’ll create tags, releases, and release notes.

#### Setup 
[Click here to get started](https://github.com/SEIBootcamps/release-based-workflow/generate). This will generate a new repository based on a template just like before. Follow the instructions in your new repository’s README file when it appears.


### Connect the Dots
You’ll work with repositories with a lot of history, where you’ll need to track down related issues and pull requests in the past or find who committed a particular change. This lab will familiarize yourself with how to navigate your workspace.

#### Setup
[Click here to get started](https://github.com/SEIBootcamps/connect-the-dots/generate). Follow the instructions in your new repository’s README file when it appears.


## GitHub Actions
Learn how to set up an Actions workflow that will check emoji shortcode references in Markdown files.

#### Setup

## Continuous Integration
[Continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) can help you stick to your team’s quality standards by running tests and reporting the results on GitHub. CI tools run builds and tests, triggered by commits. The results post back to GitHub in the pull request. The goal is fewer issues in main and faster feedback as you work. IN this lab, you’ll learn how to use GitHub Actions for CI and how to create a workflow that runs tests and produces test reports. Specifically, we’ll be using [remark-lint](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint) to check the consistency of Markdown files.
